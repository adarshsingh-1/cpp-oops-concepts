Single Ineheritance

class Human{
  string name;
  int age;
};

which constructor will be called at first
first parent constructor will be called then child constructor
But in case of destructor the child be called first then parent


Multi Level Inheritance

person  -> name, age
  |
  |---> Employee -> salary, fees
  |
  |---> Manager -> department, teamSize

Animal
  |
  |---> Dog -> breed, color
         |

Youtuber              Teacher         Gaming


              Human(It can have multiple parents properties of both parents)


Hierarchical Inheritance one is parent and multiple children 

                            Human (name, age)
                            /    \
                          /        \
                        Student()    Teacher() these both are child of Human



Hybrid Inheritance multiple parent and multiple child
                            Human (name, age)
                            /    |    \
                          /      |      \
                        Student()  Teacher()  Youtuber() these all are child of Human 
                            |         |
                          Gaming()   Developer() these both are child of Student and Teacher respectively
