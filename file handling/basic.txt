If you want to do normal tasks of files automatically, then file handling comes into place
Our codes are executed in RAM and if you want to store the results for later use. then you have to store it in secondary memory.
File handling is the process of reading and writing files in a programming language.
In C++, file handling is done using the fstream library, which provides classes for reading and writing files.
The fstream library provides three classes: ifstream, ofstream, and fstream.
ifstream is used for reading files, ofstream is used for writing files, and fstream is used for both reading and writing files.


File handling is used to store data permanently in a computer. Using file handling we can store our data in secondary memory (Hard disk).
How to achieve the File Handling
For achieving file handling we need to follow the following steps:-
STEP 1-Naming a file

STEP 2-Opening a file
STEP 3-Writing data into the file
STEP 4-Reading data from the file
STEP 5-Closing a file.
